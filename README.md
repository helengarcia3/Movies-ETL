# Movies-ETL

## Background

In this analysis we will be helping Britta at Amazing Prime. We will be creating and automated pipeline to take in new data, trasom it and load the data into existing tables. We have refactored the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.




## Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files


## Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data



## Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data


## Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
